1- GOTOGODS:
An innovative platform that allows fans to book live meetings with STARS.

 
Abstract:
The 6 Degrees of separation theory, developed by the Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in 1929, affirms that every person on Earth can be connected to any other person through a chain of individual relationships that includes up to five other links. 
GOTOGODS is the platform that allows you to have direct contact with the celebrity of your choice.
 
The theory can be illustrated today through websites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and others, which put into evidence the connections that we have with a considerable number of people, but also the connections that we can have with unknown people through tools of friend suggestions for instance. It is more evident that it signals the degree of separation between two individuals as well as the possible “paths” to link an individual to another through their respective relational networks. Our goal is therefore to make the P2P with stars a concrete reality.  

Who has never dreamt of talking to his/her Idol, even for only a few moments? GOTOGODS was born from this dream: allowing every fan to communicate directly with influential persons such as actors (Brad Pitt, Scarlett Johansson, Ryan Gosling), athletes (Neymar, Floyd Mayweather, Lebron James), artists (Drake, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Enrique iglesias), Stylists (Olivier Rousteing, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Philipp Plein), Web influencers (Kim Kardashian, Squeezie, Jennifer Selter, Kylie Jenner), politicians (Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, Matteo Salvini), or public speakers (Tony Robbins, Laurent Alexandre, Eric Thomas)… Regardless of the field, we all have at least a key celebrity in our life.
 
 
 
The persisting problems and the solutions that GOTOGODS provides.
 
 
 
Time:
 
An influencer or an international star does not necessarily have the time to talk to his fans during events: GOTOGODS wants to make this possible and simplify the processes.
 
Economies:
 
A person with low incomes does not necessarily have the opportunity to travel and pay the price of a concert or convention to meet his idol: GOTOGODS reduces costs.
 
 
Payment:
 
By monetizing their interventions, celebrities and influential people could earn their own salary through our platform: GOTOGODS considers time as precious.

 
Technology:
 
Approved by many celebrities, finally an opportunity for stars to use Blockchain technology on a daily basis.


 
 


 
WHY GOTOGODS?
 
Free Registration:
The registration will be totally free of charge for both the fans and the stars.
 
 
Secured Platform:
GOTOGOD’s secure platform will use the Ethereum Blockchain known for its efficiency, transparency and security.
 
KYC:
No fraud allowed on GOTOGODS and a KYC will be systematically demanded for fans and stars alike.
 


How does it works?
 
But what are we going to do to drive you in the middle of the stars and allow you to make your dream as a child come true? It is simple. You just have to check the calendar on GOTOGODS to book a live-meeting with the star of your choice. 

The stars will be invited to submit their availabilities on our platform. They will offer then the dates and the type of lives they prefer. Every fan will also have the opportunity to request a live with the celebrity of his/her choice. With 3 options of lives, the fans and the stars will have the choice between: P2P, P2MULTI, and P2ALL.
 
If GOTOGODS is a project aimed at generating financial gains, it is nonetheless a formidable tool for democratizing knowledge and exchanges. 
From now on, attending an enriching conference, or taking the time to debate with an inspiring personality will be within everyone’s reach. It will also make it possible to solicit and attract the attention of an influential person to an innovative project. 

GOTOGODS is committed to social networks and is making a significant contribution to revolutionizing the meaning the word “possible”.
 


For the Star:
With GOTOGODS, the star will choose when to work on our platform according to his/her schedule.
The star can:
Create a profile and build a community on GOTOGODS.
Publish content (photos, videos) and choose to monetize it or not.
Monetize Sms (the star must reply to activate the payments, otherwise the funds are refunded to the fans).
Monetize a live on GOTOGODS.
Receive donations in crypto-asset (GOTOGODS, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) from the fans.
Sell products in the integrated E-commerce space. Here, the star can sell dedicated products (T-shirts, albums, etc.), and more.
 
Our E-commerce space will offer the opportunity  to sell their products (signed products and others). However, the products will not be sold directly on GOTOGODS. Indeed, this space will consist of a showcase allowing to consult the list of products proposed by the star. A link will redirect the fan to the specific store. To do this, a specific subscription (monthly or annual) will be offered to each celebrity.

 

For the Fan:
The Fan will be able to request a private live with celebrities.
The fan can: 
Create a profile and share content (photos, videos). Follow his idols, and his friends on GOTOGODS.
Create groups, and monetize them (By making the access paying.
Payment here, is only made in GOTOGODS tokens).
Book his idol (for a video call, an audio call, or for a video dedication).
Send messages directly to his idol (If the star doesn’t answer, she won’t receive the payment).
Make donations in crypto to his idol (e.g. to support his album, film or birthday).
 
Whether the star is present or not on GOTOGODS, fans will have to block some funds (for at least 24 hours) for our system to validate their requests. This will serve as reliable statistics and will also be a way for fans to prove that their demands are serious.

Fans will have a copy of their conversations with stars; so they will be able to download these unforgettable memories or share them with friends etc.

 
 

Use case:
 
P2P: 1 fan + 1 star.
 
It is a video call (or audio call) which offers the possibility for a fan to have his/her star for his/her own: The star will do a video call with only 1 fan. During the conversation, the fan can send virtual gifts or documents (photo, etc.) to the star.
 
 

P2MULTI: 3 fans + 1 star.
 
This option allows a video call with 3 fans. The time of the conversation will be divided equally between the 3 fans. A timer will be set. It us up to stars to assign the speech alternately to his/her 3 speakers.  


P2ALL: All the fans + 1 star.
 
In this case, the star makes a video live to all of his/her community fans (for example, Madonna playing guitar in her living room live). All  fans can have access to the video live by paying an entrance fee.
 

 
 
2- GOTOGODS : 
An ambitious and social project.
 
 
A  celebrity such as Tony Robbins will not have the time to converse with his each of his fans or to hold a conference in the whole world. 

For a person with low incomes, speak to Tony Robbins or assist to one of his conferences is simply impossible. 

Between the plane ticket, the hotel, and the price of the conference, the person can forget his dream... GOTOGODS will make that dream possible. 

However, GOTOGODS will also be a source of consequent revenue for the stars. Let’s take the most eloquent example of a Tony Robbins conference:

 
Case number 1:
One conference: By giving a conference  with 1000 persons for 100 USD/person, we get, without considering the fees: 1000 × 100 USD= 100 000 USD.
 

Case number 2:
The same conference + diffusion on YouTube. It can be interesting to diffuse in real time, then rebroadcast a conference on YouTube. We will get: 1000 × 100 USD= 100 000 USD. That’s right! On YouTube, he will receive, in addition to additional views and subscriptions, only a ridiculous income.
 


Case number 3:
The same conference + diffusion on GOTOGODS. 
If 1% of Tony Robbins fans on Facebook and absent from the conference (3,8M×1 ÷ 100 = 38 000 fans) pay only 10 USD to attend the same conference live around the world, you get: (1000 × 100 USD).
 
+  X% of his fans around the world who have paid for their access to the live show, that makes: (1000×100USD) + (38000×10 USD) = 480 000 USD. 

On GOTOGODS, Tony Robbins will earn much more by opening his live to a global audience, while reducing the cost of access to his live conference. 

He will thus be a financially and humanly winner: he will have the satisfaction of giving his advice to the most vulnerable audiences and sharing his experience with them.



3- GOTOGODS: 
A token to have access to our services.
The Blockchain technology offers infinite possibilities, which is why we have chosen to integrate it, in addition to traditional payment methods (Credit card, Paypal, E-pass etc).
Our Token will be a payment method on  GOTOTGODS. The democratization of the Blockchain and the crypto-assets will have a concrete use in real life. The token will allow you to benefit from fee reductions (fees on the GOTOGODS platform).
 
 
The token will allow you to benefit from fee reductions (fees on the GOTOGODS platform).

For advertisers, this is the only accepted payment method. So, if a brand or company wishes to advertise on the GOTOGODS platform, it will have to pay in GOTOGODS tokens.

The access to all paying groups on the GOTOGODS platform is only possible via payment in GOTOGODS tokens.
